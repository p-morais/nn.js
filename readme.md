**Currently implemented:** (untested)

Layers:

* ReLu
* Affine
* SoftmaxCrossEntropy

Optimizers:

* SGD with Neseterov momentum and weight decay

Only dependency is numjs. It's currently unfinished but hopefully it will help people who want to see what a bare-bones implementation of a neural network library looks like. Feel free to pull request!
